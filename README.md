# TSA Random Arrow


## Description
The user can click anywhere within the window to generate an arrow image that randomly points right or left.  I utilized the Math.random function, event listeners, and classList method to achieve the arrow change.

## How to run
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser.
